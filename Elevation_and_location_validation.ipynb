    "To conclude, the main problem with the current script was the processing time. As the rasters have a high spatial resolution, which was needed to attempt to capture the high spatial variability, the loading and all raster operations take a long time. It was quite a challenge to figure out how to effectively extract the elevation data and validate the location of the stations, as many attempts failed due to memory running out. It would have been better to start with seperate tiles or use lower resultion DSM to find a method to extract and validate. Now, a lot of time was wasted on waiting while the method did not produce the desired results. Working with spatial data is always challenging as the projections were not entirely clear to me in the beginning. Subsequently, the locations were now selected based on the raster file which is a combination of seperate tiles. Thus it encompasses not only the area of Amsterdam, but also some area around it. Using a shapefile of the research area and use this is better to limit the area under review. I was struggeling with finding where and how to download shapefiles of the city so that is something I will do differently in the future."

While this was a choice that improved processing time of the NETATMO dataset by reducing the amount of points, it possibly also ommitted valuable data. The measurement stations located outside of the city are less influenced by buildings, UHI etc. and possible provide more accurate measurements."
